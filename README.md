Source code for projects and assignments used in CS4550

The Assignment Website (WebAppMaker) is located here: http://webdev-acolcord.rhcloud.com/assignment
- This is a web application used as a class assignment to learn all of the different aspects of the MEAN stack. This application is used so that a website 'developer' can go in and create new websites without any programming knowledge. The eventual goal is to be able to create a 'user' view so that non-developers can visit these created websites.

The Project Website (Prepper) is located here: http://webdev-acolcord.rhcloud.com/project
- This is a web application used as a class project to showcase the knowledge learned through creating the WebAppMaker. This application is intended for use by restaurants to create and organize, and search for recipes. It also has a 'Prep List' meant to organize tasks for recipes that need to be prepped, are in progress, or have been completed. It also has a 'Timers' view that allows the user to create multiple timers for the recipes, intended to be used while they are working on them.
